# PorYgon2
Discord bot originally created for /r/MysteryDungeon. Was for four years the main bot of /r/Pokemon.
Maintainers are myself and [SirThane](https://github.com/SirThane).
This bot represents about 3-4 years of my developing Python knowledge, and its current state has been a long time coming.

If you want to use some features from Porygon2 or reference it in some way, feel free.
I'd just ask that you please not re-host your own "Porygon2" bot or a bot with a similar name. Also, if you're looking to
create a new bot, I'll *also* advise you to **not** use ! as a prefix. When I created my bot in 2015, there weren't many other conflicts, but now it's likely you're going to be rubbing shoulders and possibly conflicting with another bot. Get creative!

Just as a little note, This repository represents most of Porygon2's current codebase, but does make some omissions.
