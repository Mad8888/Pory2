# PorYgon2
Discord bot originally created for /r/MysteryDungeon, but now resides
mostly in /r/Pokemon and a few other guilds. Maintainers are myself and [SirThane](https://github.com/SirThane).
This bot represents about two years of my developing Python knowledge, and its current state has been a long time coming.
It's probably at v.4.x.x at this point or something, but I haven't been keeping track.

If you want to use some features from Porygon2 or reference it in some way, feel free.
I'd just ask that you please not re-host your own "Porygon2" bot or a bot with a similar name. Also, if you're looking to
create a new bot, I'll *also* advise you to **not** use ! as a prefix. When I created my bot two years ago, it was alright,
but now it's likely you're going to conflict with at least something.

Just as a little note, This repository represents most of Porygon2's current codebase, but does make some omissions and
probably isn't up-to-date with the current version. I'll make an effort to keep it up to date-ish but can't really make
any guarantees.
